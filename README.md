### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samuel, currently studying Physics with Theoretical Physics at Imperial College London, class of 2023. I have a wide range of interest, including quantitative finance, statistical modelling, data science and scientific research. The rigorous mathematical training and active research environment refines my skills in data analysis and modelling of complex phenomenon. 

In my free time, I often read extensively in pure and applied mathematics, as well as microeconomics and macroeconomics. I am also a classical music enthusiast, who have played both the Bb and bass clarinet in the past. I keep a comprehensive discography on symphonies of the late romantic period, with particular emphasis on Brahms and Mahler.

Please feel free to reach me at
